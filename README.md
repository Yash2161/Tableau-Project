# Tableau-Project
# Created an interactive Tableau dashboard featuring histograms, line charts, 
and heatmaps to visualize average house prices across regions. 
# Employed histograms to display the distribution of house prices within each 
region, providing insights into pricing variations. 
# Utilized line charts to illustrate trends in house prices over time, enabling users 
to identify temporal patterns and fluctuations. 
# Integrated heatmaps to visualize spatial patterns and correlations between 
house prices and geographic factors, facilitating deeper analysis of regional 
disparities and market dynamics.
