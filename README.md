# Tableau-Project
1. Created an interactive Tableau dashboard featuring histograms, line charts, 
and heatmaps to visualize average house prices across regions. 
2. Employed histograms to display the distribution of house prices within each 
region, providing insights into pricing variations. 
3. Utilized line charts to illustrate trends in house prices over time, enabling users 
to identify temporal patterns and fluctuations. 
4. Integrated heatmaps to visualize spatial patterns and correlations between 
house prices and geographic factors, facilitating deeper analysis of regional 
disparities and market dynamics.
